<h3>Lighthouse:</h3>
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk/related?hl=en" target="_blank">Lighthouse Extension</a>
<p>Was used to analyze the following aspects of a URL: Performance, Progressive Web App, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO.</p>
<p>A high Lighthouse score also means that you have a well performing website. The speed that a page loads at is extremely important as users do not want to sit around waiting for your webpage to load.</p>
<h4>How to access Lighthouse without Extension:</h4>
<ol><li>On any website if you are on windows you can press F12 on your keyboard and it will open the developer tool. From there you can access Lighthouse</li>
<li>You can also right click on pages and click "Inspect" and you'll have the same pathway to Lighthouse through developer tools.</li></ol><!--Comment--><hr>

<p>Was used to construct the core of the website.</p>
<p><h4>Why HTML :</h4>HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images for Internet browsers. Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements.</p><!--Comment--><hr>

<h3>CSS:</h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a>
<p>Was used to style the website after the core was made.</p>
<p><h4>Why CSS :</h4>CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more.</p><!--Comment--><hr>

<h3>JavaScript:</h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>
<p>Makes responsive design easier.</p>
<p><h4>Why JavaScript :</h4>JavaScript has become integral to the Internet experience as developers build increased interaction and complexity into their applications. Search engines, ecommerce, content management systems, responsive design, social media and phone apps would not be possible without it.</p><!--Comment--><hr>
